* Thinking

With an operational and (hopefully) scalable batch hacking system the
main blocker to rapidly installing augments and boosting stats is
gaining the reputation needed to buy them with factions.

For this reason, I think Tian Di Hui is perhaps the META for which
faction to target first, because most of the augments they sell relate
to increased company and faction reputation gain.

Most of the other easily accessible factions (city factions, hacker
groups) have almost no augments that boost reputation gain.
