## Dev Environment Tips

- Only work on code in the `src` directory.
- When building UI elements always use colors from the theme, which
  can be retrieved with `ns.ui.getTheme()`.

## Testing Instructions

- Check that the build still works with `npm run build`
- Fix any type errors until the build completes with no errors or warnings
