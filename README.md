Awesome scripts for Bitburner


# Interesting things to remember

- Nuking a server only requires being able to open enough ports. Hacking
  level doesn't matter.
- Once a server has been nuked it can be used to run scripts.
- Growing and weakening a server also aren't limited by the hacking
  level (apparently? more testing needed on exact parameters).
- Hacking, growing and weakening are done on a percentage basis. So to
  get maximum cashflow from a server it's best to hack it often at
  fairly low thread counts, so the change isn't too large.
- The same script can't be launched multiple times on a single server,
  but different args make it a different script. So multiple instances
  can be launched simply by passing dummy arguments to differentiate.
