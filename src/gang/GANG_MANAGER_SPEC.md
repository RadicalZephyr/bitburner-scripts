Here’s a proposed, phase-by-phase roadmap to evolve your gang manager from a bare-bones recruiter/trainer into a fully dynamic, ROI-driven lifecycle controller:

---

## **Phase 0 (MVP): Recruit & Train**

**Goal:** Automatically fill all 12 slots and push every member into your chosen training task.

* **RecruitmentManager**

  * Watch `ns.gang.getMemberNames()` → if count < 12 and Respect ≥ nextRecruitReq\[count+1], call `ns.gang.createMember()`.
* **TrainingAssignment**

  * On each tick, for each member:

    * If state === `"training"` → assign your fastest-XP training task (e.g. “Train Combat”).
* **Config**

  * `recruitReqByCount: number[]` → map of members to required Respect.
  * `trainingTask: string`.

**Deliverable:** TypeScript module that fills slots and assigns everyone to `trainingTask` every tick.

---

## **Phase 1: Bootstrapping & Dynamic Thresholds**

**Goal:** Don’t let new recruits sit idle—they train→ascend→retrain to get up to group-median multiplier before “working.”

* **ThresholdsByCount**

  * Define per-count maps: `{ trainLevel, ascendMult }`.
* **Bootstrap State Machine**

  * States: `"recruited" → "bootstrapping" → "ready"`.
  * Bootstrapping: cycle training & ascend until ascension mult ≥ median of active members.
* **MemberStates** persisted in a `Map<string,State>`.

**Deliverable:** Refactor Phase 0 into modules (`RecruitmentManager`, `LifecycleManager`) with dynamic thresholds.

---

## **Phase 2: Simple Working & Respect/Money Split**

**Goal:** Once a member is `"ready"`, assign them to either respect- or money-earning tasks so you can keep recruiting.

* **TaskBalancer**

  * Track `curRespect` and `nextReq = recruitReqByCount[count+1]`.
  * Compute `respectDeficit = nextReq – curRespect`.
  * If `respectDeficit > 0`, assign `respectPct` of ready members to best respect task, rest to best money task.
* **Config**

  * `recruitHorizon` (seconds you’re willing to spend on next recruit).

**Deliverable:** Module that balances tasks to hit both Respect and cash goals.

---

## **Phase 3: ROI-Driven Equipment & Velocity-Based Ascension**

**Goal:** Automate gear buys and smarter ascension triggers.

* **EquipmentManager**

  * For each `"training"` member: ROI = cost / (level-gain-rate) → buy if ≤ `maxROITime.train`.
  * For each `"working"` member: ROI = cost / (money-gain-rate) → buy if ≤ `maxROITime.work`.
* **VelocityTracker**

  * Sample levels every tick → compute levels/sec → ascend when velocity < `velThresh[count]`.

**Deliverable:** Integrate `EquipmentManager` and `VelocityTracker` into `LifecycleManager`.

---

## **Phase 4: Territory Warfare & Full Lifecycle**

**Goal:** Factor in territory control, danger of death, and full recruit→bootstrap→work→ascend loop.

* **TerritoryManager**

  * Every 20 s tick, measure `ns.gang.getTerritory()`, compute current power.
  * Balance “Territory Warfare” assignments vs. money/respect tasks to maximize global ROI.
* **Death Handling**

  * Detect deaths via `ns.gang.getMemberInformation().state`, re-recruit or skip.
* **Full State Machine**

  * States: `training`, `bootstrapping`, `respectGrind`, `moneyGrind`, `territoryWarfare`, `ascending`.

**Deliverable:** Single orchestrator that, on each tick, updates states, thresholds, tasks, equipment, territory.
