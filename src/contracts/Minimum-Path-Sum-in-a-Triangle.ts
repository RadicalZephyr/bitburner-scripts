/* Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. In
 * each step of the path, you may only move to adjacent numbers in the
 * row below. The triangle is represented as a 2D array of numbers:
 *
 * [
 *            [6],
 *           [9,9],
 *          [6,2,7],
 *         [2,8,3,3],
 *        [2,1,3,9,8],
 *       [5,9,2,7,1,8],
 *      [4,7,6,2,4,8,6],
 *     [1,4,4,1,4,2,6,1],
 *    [4,5,9,2,7,3,4,9,3],
 *   [9,7,7,9,1,7,4,3,5,6]
 * ]
 *
 * Example: If you are given the following triangle:
 *
 * [
 *      [2],
 *     [3,4],
 *    [6,5,7],
 *   [4,1,8,3]
 * ]
 *
 * The minimum path sum is 11 (2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1).
