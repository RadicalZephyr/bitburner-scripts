/* HammingCodes: Encoded Binary to Integer

You are given the following encoded binary string:
'10001001000000111011111010101100'

 - Decode it as an 'extended Hamming code' and convert it to a decimal value.
 - Parity bits are inserted at positions 0 and 2^N.
 - Parity bits are used to make the total number of '1' bits in a
   given set of data even.
 - The parity bit at position 0 considers all bits including parity bits.
 - Each parity bit at position 2^N alternately considers N bits then
   ignores N bits, starting at position 2^N.
 - The endianness of the parity bits is reversed compared to the
   endianness of the data bits:
 - Data bits are encoded most significant bit first and the parity
   bits encoded least significant bit first.
 - The parity bit at position 0 is set last.
 - There is a ~55% chance for an altered bit at a random index.
 - Find the possible altered bit, fix it and extract the decimal value.

Examples:
'11110000' passes the parity checks and has data bits of 1000, which
is 8 in binary.

'1001101010' fails the parity checks and needs the last bit to be
corrected to get '1001101011', after which the data bits are found to
be 10101, which is 21 in binary.
