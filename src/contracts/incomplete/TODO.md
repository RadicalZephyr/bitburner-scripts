# Spiralize Matrix

- [x] Review the puzzle description in `Spiralize-Matrix.ts` to understand expected behaviour.
- [x] Add a `solve(data: number[][])` implementation that returns the matrix in spiral order.
- [x] Use boundary indices (top, bottom, left, right) to iterate through the matrix.
- [x] Include doc comments for the new function.
- [x] Test `solve` using the example from the block comment and ensure it matches the expected output.
- [x] Run `npm run build` to make sure the code compiles without TypeScript errors.

# Subarray with Maximum Sum

- [x] Understand input format and expected output.
- [x] Implement Kadane's algorithm to compute maximum contiguous subarray sum.
- [x] Return the computed sum from `solve`.

# Unique Paths in a Grid II

- [x] Understand input grid and obstacle representation.
- [x] Build dynamic programming table to count paths avoiding obstacles.
- [x] Return the path count from `solve`.
