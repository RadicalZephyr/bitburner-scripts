/* Compression III: LZ Compression

Lempel-Ziv (LZ) compression is a data compression technique which
encodes data using references to earlier parts of the data. In this
variant of LZ, data is encoded in two types of chunk. Each chunk
begins with a length L, encoded as a single ASCII digit from 1 to 9,
followed by the chunk data, which is either:

  1. Exactly L characters, which are to be copied directly into the
     uncompressed data.
  2. A reference to an earlier part of the uncompressed data. To do
     this, the length is followed by a second ASCII digit X: each of
     the L output characters is a copy of the character X places
     before it in the uncompressed data.

For both chunk types, a length of 0 instead means the chunk ends
immediately, and the next character is the start of a new chunk. The
two chunk types alternate, starting with type 1, and the final chunk
may be of either type.

You are given the following input string:
    ILvfvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvIUvwZF6vIUvwZZF6qf10vb76qf10viwOviwOviwOvUOviwOvUO5Y1QY1QMre6Jp
Encode it using Lempel-Ziv encoding with the minimum possible output length.

Examples (some have other possible encodings of minimal length):
    abracadabra     ->  7abracad47
    mississippi     ->  4miss433ppi
    aAAaAAaAaAA     ->  3aAA53035
    2718281828      ->  627182844
    abcdefghijk     ->  9abcdefghi02jk
    aaaaaaaaaaaa    ->  3aaa91
    aaaaaaaaaaaaa   ->  1a91031
    aaaaaaaaaaaaaa  ->  1a91041
