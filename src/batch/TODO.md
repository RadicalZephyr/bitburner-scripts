# Make Monitor sort by Actual Money per Second

# Make monitor server names clickable

Clicking the server name will open the tail window of the process
supervising the phase that server is in (i.e. till, sow or harvest)
using (`ns.ui.openTail`).

# Scale up batches sizes if ram is available

Change harvest to scale up batch sizes to hack up to 25% of a server's
money every batch.
