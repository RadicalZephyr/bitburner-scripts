# Corporation Contributor Guide

These scripts automate company management using the `ns.corporation` APIs. Code here sets up divisions, manages warehouses and adjusts production through helper modules in the `init` directory.

Refer to the detailed articles in `docs/corporation/` when extending features. Keep the documentation current and rely on corporation API calls rather than manual UI steps.
